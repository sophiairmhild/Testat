#!/usr/bin/env expect
#
# This script runs the specified shell in a temporary directory, and
# executes the .t test specifications.
#
# The implementation of getting expected values back from the shell is
# not terribly robust, but was a lot simpler, as a first stab, to fit
# into expect's way of doing things.  I thought about either having a
# ptrace'ing wrapper around the shell that watches for forks and so
# on, or more wrapper commands in the spirit of those already present,
# but maybe once someone complains.
#
# Even a ptrace approach that spits out child exit statuses can get
# confused by things like prompts that execute commands.  So maybe
# we'd better keep it simple.

# symbols:
# ⏎ ⇒ newline
# ☠ ⇒ shell itself exits, with code
# → ⇒ user input
# ← ⇒ response on stdout
# ↵ ⇒ response on stdout delimited by a CR or LF
# ≠ ⇒ anything but this on stdout (at least one line)
# ✓ ⇒ expect zero exit status of previous command (not implemented)
# ✗ ⇒ expect nonzero exit status of previous command (not implemented)
# ⌛ ⇒ wait a little extra (0.5 seconds)
