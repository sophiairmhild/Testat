# Time measurement in C

The two example programs show how to measure time in C.

## stopwatch.c - Measure real time

This program shows how to measure the real time (wall clock time).
It does include time a process is blocking in the measurement.

## cputime.c - Measures CPU time

This program shows how to measure the time a process is active on the CPU.
It does not measure time as long as a process is blocking.
